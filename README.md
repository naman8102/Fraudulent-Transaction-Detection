# Fraudulent-Transaction-Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using advanced machine learning algorithms. It involves data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to accurately classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent. The goal is to develop a scalable, real-time fraud detection system to enhance security in digital financial platforms.

This project aims to detect fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning algorithms, involving data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. It includes a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to upload transaction data, view predictions, and interpret results, making the fraud detection process accessible and interactive for real-time analysis
